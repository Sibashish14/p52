            It has a range of over 5000 km.Its warhead weighs about 1500 kg.Its payload or warhead can divide into 
            several, causing permanent damage at different sites.It is fully made up of composite matter.The
            composite matter helps to lower the density of the missile,enabling to carry more weapons.Unlike cruise missiles,
            it flies at great height and can carry more weapons.It is the most dangerous cruise missile in the world.
